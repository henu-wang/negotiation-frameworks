## Core Concepts

### BATNA: Your Source of Power

**BATNA** (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement) is the single most important concept in negotiation. It is what you will do if this negotiation fails.

| BATNA Strength | Example | Implications |
|---------------|---------|-------------|
| **Strong** | You have 3 job offers | You can walk away easily; negotiate aggressively |
| **Moderate** | You have a decent current job | You are not desperate but lack urgency to push hard |
| **Weak** | You are unemployed with bills due | Accept reasonable offers quickly; focus on improving BATNA |

**BATNA improvement strategies:**

1. **Create alternatives**: Apply to more jobs, get competing bids from vendors, develop in-house capabilities
2. **Improve existing alternatives**: Negotiate better terms with current employer, strengthen relationships with backup vendors
3. **Reduce dependency**: Lower your costs, extend your runway, diversify your client base

**Critical rule:** Never reveal a weak BATNA. If asked "Do you have other offers?", redirect: "I am focused on finding the right fit. Let us talk about the value I can bring to this role."

### ZOPA: The Zone of Possible Agreement

The ZOPA exists between the buyer's maximum willingness to pay and the seller's minimum acceptable price.

```
Seller's Reservation Price          Buyer's Reservation Price
         |                                    |
         |<--------- ZOPA ------------------>|
         |                                    |
    $80,000                              $120,000

    Seller won't go         Buyer won't go
    below $80K              above $120K
```

**If no ZOPA exists** (seller's minimum > buyer's maximum), no deal is possible. Recognize this early to avoid wasting time.

**ZOPA analysis template:**

```markdown
## ZOPA Analysis

My reservation price (walk-away point): $___
My aspiration price (ideal outcome):    $___
My estimate of their reservation price: $___
My estimate of their aspiration price:  $___

Estimated ZOPA: [$___ to $___]
Target agreement point: $___
```

### Reservation Price vs Aspiration Price

| Concept | Definition | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Reservation Price** | The worst deal you would accept | Prevents bad deals |
| **Aspiration Price** | The best realistic outcome | Prevents leaving value on the table |
| **Anchor** | The first number put on the table | Shapes the negotiation range |

**Research finding:** Negotiators who set ambitious aspiration prices consistently achieve better outcomes than those who focus only on their reservation price. Aim high, but with justification.

## Framework 1: Preparation Blueprint

### The Negotiation Prep Checklist

Complete this before any significant negotiation:

- [ ] **Define your goal**: What specific outcome do you want?
- [ ] **Identify your BATNA**: What will you do if negotiations fail?
- [ ] **Set your reservation price**: What is your walk-away point?
- [ ] **Set your aspiration price**: What is your ideal outcome?
- [ ] **Research their BATNA**: What are their alternatives?
- [ ] **Estimate the ZOPA**: Is there room for agreement?
- [ ] **List all issues**: What can be negotiated beyond price?
- [ ] **Rank your priorities**: Which issues matter most to you?
- [ ] **Anticipate their priorities**: What matters most to them?
- [ ] **Prepare your anchor**: What first offer will you make (or deflect)?
- [ ] **Plan your concessions**: What will you give up, and in what order?
- [ ] **Prepare your justifications**: Why is your position fair and reasonable?
- [ ] **Rehearse**: Practice key moments with a trusted colleague

### Information Gathering Template

```markdown
## Negotiation Intelligence

### About the Other Party
- Decision maker: ___
- Their likely BATNA: ___
- Their constraints (budget, timeline, authority): ___
- Their interests (not positions): ___
- Their past negotiation behavior: ___
- Relationship with their alternatives: ___

### Market Context

```

### Interests vs Positions

| Concept | Definition | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Position** | What you say you want | "I want $150K salary" |
| **Interest** | Why you want it | Financial security, recognition, market fairness |

**Why it matters:** Positions are often incompatible. Interests usually are not.

| Position Deadlock | Interest-Based Solution |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| "I need $150K" vs "Budget is $130K" | $130K base + $20K signing bonus + early review at 6 months |
| "Delivery must be in 4 weeks" vs "We need 8 weeks" | Phased delivery: MVP in 4 weeks, full product in 8 |
| "I want to work remotely" vs "We need people in office" | 3 days remote + 2 days office; remote Fridays guaranteed |

---

## Framework 2: Anchoring Strategy

### When to Anchor First

| Situation | Anchor First? | Reasoning |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| You have strong information about the range | Yes | Your anchor shapes the ZOPA |
| You are uncertain about the range | No | Let them anchor; you will learn information |
| You have high power (strong BATNA) | Yes | Aggressive anchor from strength is credible |
| Negotiating with an expert | Carefully | They may dismiss an unreasonable anchor |
| Multiple competing offers on the table | Yes | Use your best offer as the anchor |

### How to Set an Effective Anchor

**The anchor formula:**

```
Effective Anchor = Aspiration Price + Justifiable Stretch

Where "Justifiable Stretch" is the amount beyond your target that you can
defend with objective criteria (market data, precedent, unique value).
```

**Anchoring rules:**

1. **Be specific**: $147,500 is more anchoring than "around $150K" (precision signals research)
2. **Justify immediately**: "Based on Levels.fyi data for this role in this market, the range is $140K-$160K"
3. **Anchor ambitiously but credibly**: Too extreme and you lose credibility; too modest and you leave money on the table
4. **Present multiple anchors**: "Companies at your stage typically pay $140K-$165K for this role"

### Defending Against Anchors

When the other party anchors first:

1. **Do not counter-anchor immediately** — this validates their range
2. **Acknowledge without accepting**: "I appreciate you sharing that. Let me share how I am thinking about this."
3. **Re-anchor with your own number and justification**
4. **Ask how they arrived at their number**: Often exposes weak reasoning

---

## Framework 3: Concession Strategy

### The Concession Pattern

Never make concessions of equal size. Use a **decreasing pattern** to signal you are approaching your limit:

```
Round 1: Concede $10,000  (signals flexibility)
Round 2: Concede  $5,000  (signals narrowing room)
Round 3: Concede  $2,000  (signals near the limit)
Round 4: Concede    $500  (signals final offer territory)
```

**Rules for concessions:**

| Rule | Reasoning |
|------|-----------|
| Never concede without getting something in return | Unilateral concessions signal weakness |
| Make concessions smaller over time | Signals you are approaching your limit |
| Label your concessions | "I am making an exception here because..." increases perceived value |
| Keep track of all concessions made by both sides | Prevents asymmetric generosity |
| Never split the difference first | The person who suggests splitting loses leverage |

### Trading Concessions for Value

Every concession should be paired with a request:

```
"I can do [concession] if you can [request]."

Examples:
- "I can accept the lower base if we can include a signing bonus of $X."
- "I can extend the payment terms to 60 days if the contract is for 24 months instead of 12."
- "I can reduce the scope if we can accelerate the timeline."
```

### The Reciprocity Principle

Humans have a deep psychological need to reciprocate. Use this strategically:

1. **Give first**: Small, thoughtful concessions early create obligation
2. **Make concessions visible**: Explain what it costs you to concede
3. **Request reciprocity explicitly**: "I have moved on price. Can you move on timeline?"
4. **Match the scale**: Small concessions justify small reciprocity; large concessions justify large reciprocity

## Framework 4: Multi-Issue Negotiations

### Issue Scoring Matrix

Before negotiating, score each issue by importance and flexibility:

| Issue | Importance (1-10) | My Ideal | My Walk-Away | Their Likely Priority |
|-------|-------------------|----------|-------------|----------------------|
| Salary | 9 | $160K | $140K | Medium (budget exists) |
| Equity | 7 | 0.5% | 0.2% | Low (early stage) |
| Start date | 3 | 4 weeks | 2 weeks | High (urgent need) |
| Remote work | 8 | 4 days/week | 2 days/week | Medium |
| Title | 4 | Director | Senior | Low |

### Logrolling: Trading Across Issues

Logrolling means conceding on issues you care less about in exchange for wins on issues you care more about.

**From the table above:**
- I care less about start date (3) and title (4)
- They likely care a lot about start date
- **Trade**: I accept a 2-week start date and "Senior" title in exchange for 4 days remote and 0.4% equity

### Package Deals vs Issue-by-Issue

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| **Package deal** | Enables logrolling; harder to get stuck on one issue | More complex to evaluate | Multi-issue negotiations with trade-off potential |
| **Issue-by-issue** | Simpler; clear progress | Easy to get stuck; no trade-offs | Simple negotiations with few issues |

**Default recommendation:** Always negotiate as a package when there are 3+ issues. This is where the most value is created.

---

## Framework 5: Salary Negotiation

### The Complete Salary Negotiation Playbook

**Phase 1: Research (before any conversation)**

| Data Source | What to Look For |
|------------|-----------------|
| Levels.fyi | Exact compensation bands by company, level, location |
| Glassdoor | Salary ranges and interview experiences |
| Blind | Anonymous comp data from verified employees |
| LinkedIn | Job postings that include salary ranges |
| Salary.com | Traditional salary benchmarks |
| Network | Ask peers at similar levels (many are willing to share) |

**Phase 2: Deflect early salary questions**

If asked "What are your salary expectations?" early in the process:

> "I would like to learn more about the role and responsibilities before discussing compensation. I am confident we can find a number that works for both of us. What is the range budgeted for this position?"

**Phase 3: After receiving an offer**

1. **Express enthusiasm** (never criticize the offer)
2. **Ask for time**: "Thank you. I am excited about this. Can I have until [2-3 days] to review the full package?"
3. **Analyze** using the Issue Scoring Matrix above
4. **Counter** using your anchor and justification

**Phase 4: The counter conversation**

```
"Thank you for the offer. I am genuinely excited about this role and the team.

After researching market rates for [role] at [level] in [city], and considering
my experience with [specific high-value skill/achievement], I was targeting a
base salary of $[anchor].

Specifically, I am basing this on:
1. [Data point 1: market data]
2. [Data point 2: comparable offers or current comp]
3. [Data point 3: unique value you bring]

Is there flexibility to get closer to that range?"
```

### Script Templates

**Responding to "That is above our range":**

> "I understand there may be constraints on base salary. Could we explore other parts of the package? For instance, a signing bonus, additional equity, or an accelerated performance review at 6 months?"

**Responding to "This is our final offer":**

> "I appreciate your transparency. Before I make my final decision, could you help me understand — is there any flexibility on [specific non-salary item like equity, start date, title, or remote policy]?"

**If you have a competing offer:**

> "I want to be straightforward — I have received another offer at $[amount]. I prefer your company because of [genuine reason], but I want to make sure the compensation reflects the market. Can we find a way to close the gap?"

### Negotiating Beyond Base Salary

| Component | Negotiability | Typical Flexibility |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Base salary | Medium | 5-15% above initial offer |
| Signing bonus | High | Often used to bridge salary gaps |
| Equity/RSUs | Medium-High | Especially at startups |
| Annual bonus target | Low | Usually set by band |
| PTO/vacation | Medium | 1-2 extra weeks is common |
| Remote flexibility | High | Growing acceptance |
| Title | Medium-High | Low cost for employer, high signal value |
| Relocation package | High | If applicable |
| Learning budget | High | $1K-$10K is common |
| Start date | High | 2-6 weeks flexibility typical |

---

## Framework 6: Business Deal Negotiation

### Vendor Contract Negotiation

| Lever | Tactic |
|-------|--------|
| **Price** | Get 3+ competing quotes; ask for volume discounts; request annual pricing vs monthly |
| **Payment terms** | Negotiate Net 60 or Net 90; request quarterly instead of monthly billing |
| **Contract length** | Shorter commitment for first contract; longer for discounts |
| **SLA** | Define uptime guarantees with financial penalties; specify response times |
| **Exit clause** | 30-day termination with prorated refund; data export guarantees |
| **Auto-renewal** | Remove auto-renewal or require 90-day notice |

### Partnership Agreement Framework

| Topic | Must Align On |
|-------|-------------|
| **Value exchange** | What does each party contribute and receive? |
| **Revenue sharing** | Percentage split, measurement method, payment terms |
| **Exclusivity** | Is either party restricted from working with competitors? |
| **IP ownership** | Who owns what is created during the partnership? |
| **Duration** | Fixed term with renewal option vs evergreen |
| **Termination** | Conditions, notice period, wind-down obligations |
| **Dispute resolution** | Mediation, then arbitration, then litigation (specify jurisdiction) |

---

## Framework 7: Difficult Negotiations

### Dealing with Hardball Tactics

| Tactic | How to Recognize It | How to Counter It |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Good cop / Bad cop** | One person is harsh, another is sympathetic | Address both as a team: "I would like to negotiate with your team, not between members of it" |
| **Artificial deadline** | "This offer expires at midnight" | Test it: "If I need one more day, does the deal really disappear?" |
| **Nibbling** | Adding small demands after agreement in principle | "We agreed on the package. Adding items now means reopening the whole negotiation" |
| **Highball/Lowball** | Extreme opening offer meant to anchor | Ignore the anchor; re-anchor with your data |
| **Flinching** | Dramatic negative reaction to your proposal | Pause. Do not immediately concede. Ask "What specifically concerns you?" |
| **Take it or leave it** | Refusing to negotiate | "I respect that position. Before I decide, can you help me understand the reasoning?" |

### Negotiating with More Powerful Parties

When you have less power:

1. **Prepare more** — Knowledge compensates for power
2. **Build coalitions** — Unite with others in similar positions
3. **Focus on interests, not positions** — Find ways to create value for both sides
4. **Use objective criteria** — Market data and precedent level the playing field
5. **Strengthen your BATNA** — Even a small improvement changes the dynamic
6. **Be willing to walk away** — The willingness to walk away is itself a source of power

### Deadlock Breaking Strategies

| Strategy | How It Works |
|----------|-------------|
| **Change the people** | Bring in a neutral mediator or escalate to higher-level decision makers |
| **Change the scope** | Add or remove issues to create new trade-off possibilities |
| **Change the timeline** | Phased agreements: agree on what you can now, defer contentious issues |
| **Change the frame** | Reframe from "dividing the pie" to "growing the pie together" |
| **Take a break** | Emotions cool; new perspectives emerge |
| **Use objective criteria** | Agree to let market data, precedent, or an expert decide |

---

## Framework 8: Cross-Cultural Negotiation

| Dimension | Western (US/UK/AU) | East Asian (CN/JP/KR) | Middle Eastern | Latin American |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Pace** | Fast, get to business | Slow, build relationship first | Moderate, hospitality matters | Relationship-first |
| **Direct/Indirect** | Direct | Indirect (saving face) | Moderately direct | Indirect |
| **Decision making** | Individual authority | Consensus-based | Hierarchical | Hierarchical |
| **Contracts** | Detailed, binding | Framework, flexible | Framework with trust | Flexible |
| **Silence** | Uncomfortable | Normal, strategic | Varies | Varies |

**Universal rules:**
- Research cultural norms before negotiating across cultures
- When in doubt, be more formal, not less
- Build relationships before discussing business terms
- Show respect for hierarchy and seniority
- Avoid assumptions; ask questions

## Decision Rules for Common Scenarios

### Should I negotiate this?

| Situation | Negotiate? | Reasoning |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Job offer from a company you want to join | Always | Companies expect it; you will never have more leverage |
| Salary at current job | Yes, annually | Staying without negotiating means falling behind market |
| Freelance rate with new client | Always | Sets the baseline for the entire relationship |
| Vendor contract renewal | Always | Switching costs give you leverage; they want to keep you |
| Car purchase | Always | Markup is substantial; dealers expect negotiation |
| Rent with individual landlord | Often | Especially in soft markets or for long-term leases |
| Retail purchase (fixed price) | Rarely | Low ROI for your time |

### When to walk away

Walk away when:
- The best available deal is worse than your BATNA
- The other party negotiates in bad faith (lies, hidden terms)
- You feel pressured to decide without adequate information
- The deal requires compromising a core principle
- The relationship cost of the negotiation exceeds the deal value
