## Negotiation Fundamentals

### The Two Schools

| School | Philosophy | Key Authors |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Principled (Win-Win)** | Expand the pie, find mutual gains | Fisher & Ury (Harvard) |
| **Tactical (Psychological)** | Leverage psychology, emotional intelligence | Chris Voss (FBI) |

**Best approach:** Combine both. Use principled negotiation for structure and tactical empathy for execution.

### The Golden Rules

1. **Never negotiate against yourself** — Don't make concessions without receiving something in return
2. **The person who cares less has more power** — Your BATNA determines your leverage
3. **Listen more than you talk** — Information is power; every word they say reveals interests
4. **Preparation is 90% of negotiation** — The work happens before you sit down
5. **Never split the difference** — Creative solutions often beat 50/50 compromises

---

## Frameworks

### 1. BATNA (Best Alternative)

**Origin:** Roger Fisher & William Ury, *Getting to Yes*

**Definition:** Your Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement — what you'll do if the negotiation fails.

**Why it matters:** Your BATNA is the source of your negotiation power. A strong BATNA means you can walk away; no BATNA means you're desperate.

**How to develop:**

```markdown
## BATNA Analysis

### My BATNA
1. What will I do if this negotiation fails?
   →
2. What's the value of my best alternative?
   →
3. Can I improve my BATNA before negotiating?
   →

### Their BATNA (estimate)
1. What will they do if this negotiation fails?
   →
2. How good are their alternatives?
   →
3. Can I weaken their BATNA?
   →

### Implication
My walk-away point: $___ or [condition]
Their likely walk-away point: $___ or [condition]
```

**Key insight:** Never enter a negotiation without a BATNA. If yours is weak, improve it before negotiating.

---

### 2. ZOPA (Zone of Possible Agreement)

**Definition:** The range between both parties' reservation prices where a deal is possible.

```
Buyer's max         Seller's min
    $90K                $75K
      |    ZOPA = $75K-$90K    |
      |◄──────────────────────►|
$60K ─────────────────────────────── $100K
Buyer wants to pay         Seller wants to receive
as little as possible      as much as possible
```

**If ZOPA exists:** Negotiation is about where in the zone you land
**If no ZOPA:** No deal is possible without changing the variables

**How to find the ZOPA:**
1. Determine your reservation price (absolute walk-away)
2. Estimate their reservation price
3. If overlap exists → negotiate within the zone
4. If no overlap → either expand the pie (add issues) or walk away

---

### 3. Tactical Empathy (Chris Voss)

**Origin:** Chris Voss, *Never Split the Difference*

**Core tools:**

| Technique | How to Use | Example |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Mirroring** | Repeat the last 1-3 words as a question | "You're having budget issues?" |
| **Labeling** | Name the other person's emotion | "It sounds like you're frustrated with the timeline." |
| **Calibrated Questions** | Ask "How" and "What" questions (never "Why") | "How am I supposed to do that?" "What's the biggest challenge here?" |
| **Accusation Audit** | List every negative thing they could think about you, upfront | "You probably think we're too expensive, too slow, and hard to work with..." |
| **Late-night FM DJ voice** | Slow, calm, downward-inflecting tone | Conveys authority and calm |
| **Strategic "No"** | Get them to say "that's right" by summarizing their position | Summarize until they say "that's right" (NOT "you're right") |

**The goal:** Make the other person feel heard and understood. When people feel understood, their guard drops and they become collaborative.

---

### 4. Principled Negotiation (Harvard)

**Origin:** Fisher & Ury, *Getting to Yes*

**Four principles:**

| Principle | Description | Tactic |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Separate people from problem** | Attack the problem, not the person | Use "we" language, acknowledge emotions |
| **Focus on interests, not positions** | Understand WHY they want what they want | Ask "Why is that important to you?" |
| **Generate options for mutual gain** | Brainstorm before deciding | "What if we..." sessions |
| **Insist on objective criteria** | Use fair standards, not willpower | Market rates, precedent, expert opinion |

**Positions vs. Interests example:**
```
Position: "I want a corner office" (what they say)
Interest: "I need privacy for client calls and recognition for my seniority" (what they need)

Solution: Private phone booth + title change (satisfies interest, not position)
```

---

### 5. Anchoring Strategy

**Principle:** The first number on the table heavily influences the final outcome.

**When to anchor first:**
- You have good information about the market/value
- You want to frame the negotiation

**When to let them anchor:**
- You have less information than they do
- Their anchor might reveal useful information

**Counter-anchoring techniques:**
1. **Ignore it:** Don't engage with an extreme anchor. Reset the conversation.
2. **Re-anchor:** Provide your own well-researched counter-anchor
3. **Use objective criteria:** "Based on market data, the range is..."
4. **Break it down:** "Help me understand how you arrived at that number"

---

### 6. The Ackerman Model

**Origin:** Used by the CIA for hostage negotiations, popularized by Chris Voss

**Process for price negotiations:**

```
Step 1: Set your target price (your goal)
Step 2: Your first offer = 65% of target
Step 3: Plan three raises: 85%, 95%, 100% of target
Step 4: Use empathy and calibrated questions between offers
Step 5: On your final number, use a non-round figure ($37,893 not $38,000)
Step 6: Include a non-monetary item with the final offer

Example (buying, target = $100K):
  Offer 1: $65,000   (65%)
  Offer 2: $85,000   (85%) + empathy + "How am I supposed to do that?"
  Offer 3: $95,000   (95%) + label their constraints
  Offer 4: $100,000  (100%) exact — appears calculated, not arbitrary
  Final:   $99,723   + include non-monetary item (closing timeline, warranty)
```

**Why it works:**
- Decreasing increments signal you're reaching your limit
- Precise numbers appear researched and calculated
- Non-monetary items show flexibility and creativity

### 7. Cialdini's Influence Principles

**Origin:** Robert Cialdini, *Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion*

| Principle | Application in Negotiation |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Reciprocity** | Give something first (information, concession, help) |
| **Commitment/Consistency** | Get small agreements early; people want to stay consistent |
| **Social Proof** | "Other companies in your position have found this works well" |
| **Authority** | Reference experts, data, credentials |
| **Liking** | Build genuine rapport; find common ground |
| **Scarcity** | "This offer is available until Friday" (only if genuine) |
| **Unity** | "We're in this together" — shared identity |

---

### 8. Logrolling (Trading Across Issues)

**Definition:** Identifying issues where parties have different priorities and trading concessions.

**Process:**
1. List all negotiable issues
2. Rank each party's priorities
3. Find complementary differences
4. Trade: concede on low-priority items in exchange for gains on high-priority items

```
Issue          My Priority   Their Priority   Trade Opportunity
Price          HIGH          HIGH             Hard to trade (both care)
Timeline       LOW           HIGH             I can concede here
Payment terms  HIGH          LOW              They can concede here
Support level  MEDIUM        MEDIUM           Moderate trade value
Exclusivity    LOW           HIGH             I can concede here
```

**Outcome:** I get favorable price and payment terms; they get faster timeline and exclusivity. Both win more than a simple price split.

### 9. The Black Swan Method

**Origin:** Chris Voss — based on the concept of unknown unknowns

**Principle:** Every negotiation has 3-5 pieces of information that, if discovered, would change everything. These are "Black Swans."

**How to find Black Swans:**
- Ask open-ended questions and listen deeply
- Pay attention to what they DON'T say
- Look for inconsistencies
- Meet face-to-face when possible (more information leaks in person)
- Let silence work — people fill uncomfortable silence with information

**Types of Black Swans:**
| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Positive** | They value something you can easily provide | They need fast delivery (easy for you) |
| **Negative** | Something that would kill the deal if known | They're about to be acquired |
| **Normative** | Their underlying beliefs and values | Their CEO is personally invested in this project |

### Conflict Resolution

```markdown
## Conflict Resolution Framework

1. **Acknowledge** their perspective (labeling)
   "It sounds like you feel [emotion] about [situation]."

2. **Separate** the person from the problem
   "We both want [shared goal]. The challenge is [specific problem]."

3. **Explore** interests
   "Help me understand what's most important to you here."

4. **Generate** options together
   "What if we...?"

5. **Agree** on objective criteria
   "What would a fair solution look like to both of us?"
```

## Tactical Toolkit

### Phrases That Work

| Situation | Say This | Avoid This |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Opening | "What's the biggest challenge you're facing?" | "Here's what I want..." |
| Deadlock | "How are we supposed to move forward?" | "Take it or leave it" |
| Unreasonable demand | "How am I supposed to do that?" | "That's ridiculous" |
| Building rapport | "That's right" (after summarizing their view) | "I understand" (sounds dismissive) |
| Saying no | "How would I explain that to my team?" | "No" (blunt rejection) |
| Price pushback | "What does a fair price look like to you?" | "Our price is firm" |
| Getting information | "Tell me more about that..." | Rapid-fire questions |

### Body Language Tips
- Mirror their posture (builds unconscious rapport)
- Lean in when they're speaking (shows engagement)
- Maintain comfortable eye contact (60-70% of the time)
- Use open hand gestures (palms visible)
- Nod slowly while listening (encourages them to continue)

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Instead |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Accepting the first offer | Leaves value on the table | Always counter, even if the offer seems fair |
| Negotiating against yourself | Making concessions without receiving any | "I can do X if you can do Y" |
| Revealing your deadline | Gives the other side time leverage | Let them feel urgency, not you |
| Getting emotional | Clouds judgment, reveals information | Pause, label the emotion, take a break |
| Focusing only on price | Misses creative solutions | Negotiate the full package |
| Poor preparation | Winging it = losing | Use the prep templates above |
| Win-lose mentality | Damages relationships, misses mutual gains | Look for trades across issues |
